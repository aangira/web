    Guineafowl sometimes called <I>"pet speckled hens" </I> or <I>"original fowl"</I>
    are birds of the family Numididae in the order Galliformes. <BR>
    They are endemic to Africa and rank among the oldest of the gallinaceous birds. <BR>
    Phylogenetically, they branched off from the core Galliformes after the Cracidae (chachalacas, guans, and curassows) and before the<BR>
    Odontophoridae (New World quail). An Eocene fossil lineage Telecrex has been associated with guineafowl; Telecrex inhabited Mongolia,<BR>
    and may have given rise to the oldest of the true phasianids, such as blood pheasants and eared pheasants, which evolved into high-altitude,<BR>
    montane-adapted species with the rise of the Tibetan Plateau. While modern guineafowl species are endemic to Africa, <BR>
    the helmeted guineafowl has been introduced as a domesticated bird widely elsewhere.[1]<BR>

    Guinea fowl are typically raised for meat. They can also be kept as guard <br>
    animals since they are very vocal when anything new enters the farm yard. <br>
    Guinea fowl have also been used as a natural method for controlling ticks, <br>
    especially in areas where Lyme disease is a problem.<br>
